Started building the dashboard — a page that shows what changed while you were away.
<!--tech-->
Spec v5 merged as `c5fcb07`. Task 2 of the project-dashboard plan.

## 2026-08-29 [needs-you]
The dashboard is built and ready for you to look at. It is one page at
http://127.0.0.1:7391/dashboard with three things on it: what needs you, what changed recently in
plain words, and a small chart of how busy each of the last fourteen days was.

Two things worth knowing. Entries like this one do not get written by accident any more — a branch
that changes files and adds no entry is now refused, so the page cannot quietly stop describing the
work while still looking healthy. And if a branch genuinely has nothing worth writing, it says so in
its pull request, and the page lists those too, so you can see the rule being skipped rather than
having it happen silently.

Answers you get on a served page now also appear without you reloading it, which previously never
worked on any standing page.

**Waiting on you:** CI now checks the plan document against the code, so fixing a bug in either
script will turn CI red until the plan is edited to match. That is deliberate, but nothing says when
it stops applying, and the first person to hit it will probably just delete the check.
<!--tech-->
Tasks 1–6 of `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-28-project-dashboard-plan.md`. Ships
`scripts/check-dashboard-entry.py` (the ratchet, and the owner of the entry-header grammar),
`scripts/gen-dashboard.py`, the append-only store, `.agents/skills/dashboard/`,
`.claude/hooks/regen-dashboard.sh`, and the CI wiring in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` —
`fetch-depth: 0` plus a `pull_request`-only ratchet step.

Live reload: `/_rev` resolved via `safe_path` while the page GET used `resolve_page`, so
`/_rev?p=/dashboard` 404'd forever. One concern, two mechanisms; now one.

⚠ The ratchet has never been **seen to refuse on GitHub** — this PR is the first real exercise of
`fetch-depth: 0`, and a shallow clone is exactly what breaks it. Locally it passes on this branch
and refuses against `HEAD~1`.

## 2026-08-29 [resolved: 2026-08-29/1]
Decided: the CI check that keeps the plan document and the two dashboard scripts identical stays,
and it now says in writing when it goes away. It retires when the mutation checks are rewritten to
run against the real scripts instead of against copies pasted into the plan — not on a date, and not
by someone switching it off.

The reason to keep it at all: those mutation checks are the only thing proving the page's guards
still work, and they found four real defects while this was being built. The reason it could not
just stay forever unwritten: every future bug fix in either script would have paid a tax to a
document nobody reads, with no note explaining why, and the likeliest outcome was somebody deleting
the check to get a green build.
<!--tech-->
Option C of four. Condition recorded in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s own step comment, so the exit
ships with the thing it governs; work filed as backlog #70.

The framing that settled it: the step protects *"the mutation evidence describes the code that
ships"*. Byte-identity with `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-28-project-dashboard-plan.md` is only
the route to that, and a poor one — it keeps a second copy of 1,401 lines in a tree
`scripts/check-docs.py:46` marks `FROZEN`. Retarget the 43 mutations at the delivered scripts and
the guarantee gets stronger while the byte-identity requirement dissolves. A supersession, not a
switch-off.

## 2026-08-29
Fixed: links on the dashboard were nearly invisible in dark mode. You reported it twice — first the
blue entry titles, then the purple "Elsewhere" links — and both were the same cause: the page never
said what colour a link should be, so the browser used its own, which is chosen for white
backgrounds.

Measured rather than eyeballed. Against the dark background the old colours scored 1.9 and 1.6 out
of a required 4.5 for readable text; light mode scored 8.8 and 10.4, which is why nobody caught it —
everyone who reviewed this page, including me, was reading it in light mode. The new colours score
8.9 and 8.4 in dark, 6.6 and 6.9 in light.

A test now fails if either colour goes missing again, in either mode.
<!--tech-->
`scripts/gen-dashboard.py` had no `a{}` rule at all, so `#0000EE` and `:visited` `#551A8B` came from
the UA sheet. Adds `--link` / `--link-visited` to both `:root` scheme blocks and declares
`a` and `a:visited` explicitly — `:visited` is stated rather than left to the cascade, since
browsers restrict and mis-report visited styling.

Two self-test cases, mutation-tested four ways: deleting either rule, or defining either variable in
only one scheme, reddens exactly the case that names it. Contrast ratios computed, not judged.

⚠ Verified in a real browser at `http://127.0.0.1:7391/dashboard` — every link computes to
`rgb(140,189,224)` against `rgb(20,24,27)`. `getComputedStyle` reports the unvisited colour even for
visited links (browser privacy), so the `:visited` rule is confirmed from the served source and the
guard, not from a computed value.

⚠ First exercise of the plan-as-CI-dependency decided today: this fix required the identical edit in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-28-project-dashboard-plan.md` and an evidence regeneration. Backlog
#70 is what ends that.
